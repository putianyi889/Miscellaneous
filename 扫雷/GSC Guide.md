# Introduction

Gold Sheep Cup (GSC) is a minesweeper tournament held in April and October every year. The next will be the 9th one, from 4:00 12th to 4:00 18th UTC (which is 12:00 to 12:00 Beijing time) in October 2021.

The rules are simple. Participants need to play on Arbiter and submit all their games (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert) in this week. The host, [Jin-Yang Guo](https://minesweepergame.com/profile.php?pid=4417), will sort the results. To submit, gather all videos in to one single folder, zip them (don't zip the folder) and send the zip to qxxqlls@163.com. The sorting process is half-manual so if you make mistakes, you can contact the host to resolve them.

A player need to have a [minesweepergame.com](https://minesweepergame.com/) account or [saolei.wang](http://www.saolei.wang/Main/Index.asp) account and will be recognised as the name displayed on either minesweepergame.com or saolei.wang. The player ID on either of the sites needs to be included in the email. If you have a [Minesweeper Online](https://minesweeper.online/cn/) account and want to be eligible for [WoM resource rewards](https://github.com/putianyi889/Miscellaneous/blob/master/%E6%89%AB%E9%9B%B7/GSC%20Guide.md#wom-resources), you also need to provide your Minesweeper Online ID and/or username.

**NOTE**: when you break a personal record, Arbiter will save a copy of that video in the main folder. Be careful not to collect the same video twice.

The major competition stat is T.37 which is `BT.20+IT.12+ET.5`. B/I/E refer to Beginner/Intermediate/Expert. T refers to Time. `.n` means the sum of the best n scores. For example, Your BT.20 means the summation of your best 20 Beginner games in terms of time. There are also other competition stats, including B.37, PPP.37, T.74, B.74, PPP.74. They will be explained here later.

**NOTE**: Only >=10bbbv beg games are counted.

At the start of a GSC, the host will announce a random token. You need to append this token to your [player identification text](https://github.com/putianyi889/Miscellaneous/blob/master/%E6%89%AB%E9%9B%B7/GSC%20Guide.md#what-is-the-player-identification-text) to prove that the games are played after the tournament starts. After the end, you will have 15 minutes to gather and submit your videos which means that the deadline is 4:15 UTC.

## FAQ

### Do I need to provide my real name?
You only need your [minesweepergame.com](https://minesweepergame.com/) account or [saolei.wang](http://www.saolei.wang/Main/Index.asp) account. You will need to provide your real name to minesweepergame.com but you can choose to hide your real name and show your nickname instead. You must use your real name on saolei.wang.

### Where do I get the token?
Please focus on [saolei.wang BBS](http://www.saolei.wang/BBS/Title.asp?Id=20355) which will announce first and [minesweepergame.com forum](https://minesweepergame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&p=4336&sid=575c9f5862c6c041b9047cc1e4cd26ea#p4336) which will announce next. Otherwise you will need to ask others or wait for someone to forward the information.

### What if I don't submit enough games?
The default times are 10-60-240. The default bvs and stnb are zero.

# Arbiter FAQ

## How to download Arbiter?
You can download Arbiter from [minesweepergame.com](https://minesweepergame.com/download/arbiter.php) or [saolei.wang](http://saolei.wang/Download/Arbiter_0.52.3.zip).

You will need a Windows system. Virtual machines or simulators can work but they will have significant lag which hurts legitimacy of your videos.

## What is the player identification text?
The player identification text is a token packed with each video to claim the player's identity. Up on opening a newly downloaded Arbiter, you will see it at the bottom of the window saying "Anonymous! Press F5 for Setup". You can set it in Preferences. The player identification text is critical for the video to be valid.

**NOTE**: Player Identification Text and Replay Player Name are different. The latter only appears in your filename and does nothing towards validity.

## How do I append the token?
For example, if your ID text is `Guo Jin Yang` and the token is `G777`, then you need to change your ID text to `Guo Jin Yang G777`. The sorting process is half-manual so as long as your ID texts are consistent, whether you add a space doesn't matter. If you somehow have inconsistent ID texts, you will need to contact the host to resolve the problem.

## How do I zoom the Arbiter window?
The fundamental size of Arbiter cells are fixed as 16x16 pixels. There are workarounds to zoom it or make it look larger.

### Zoom the window
In Windows 10, enter `Display Settings`. The easiest way to do this is to right click on your desktop and choose `Display Settings`. In the section `Scale and layout`, you can `Change the size of text, apps, and other items` which will also scale Arbiter cells. However, this approach can cause windows-related glitches. For example, some streaming software may not be able to capture Arbiter window correctly.

### Make the window look larger
There are two ways of doing this. The first is to use Magnifier integrated in Windows 10. The other is to change your display resolution. You can lower your resolution down to 800x600 in `Display Settings`-`Scale and layout`-`Display resolution`.

You can also download a tool from [saolei.wang](http://saolei.wang/Download/%E5%88%86%E8%BE%A8%E7%8E%87%E8%B0%83%E6%95%B4%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7.exe) which enables 640x480 resolution. Launch the exe. Click the button to change resolution. Close the window to reset resolution.

After changing your resolution, the Arbiter window looks much larger, but your mouse speed will also feel much faster. To resolve this, if you can set your mouse's dpi, keep in mind that Arbiter cell size is 16 and adjust accordingly. If you can't set your dpi, then changing cursor speed is the only option. Go to `Control Panel`-`Hardware and Sound`-`Devices and Printers`-`Mouse`. Choose the tab `Pointer Options` and you will see the slider.

## How do I chord in Arbiter?
The only way to chord is by left+right.

## How do I save videos?
By default, Arbiter autosaves sub10.0 beg, sub50.0 int and sub150.0 exp games to folders `/replays` and `/replays2`. You can customize these from `Preferences`-`Automation`.

# Rewards

## Cash
Mathematically, there are cash rewards. However, the amount is so low that hardly anybody cares. (If you are still curious, the pool is usually a few hundreds of CNY shared by ~50 players.) We participate for honor and glory.

## WoM resources

From the 9th GSC, [Minesweeper Online](https://minesweeper.online/) resources are added to the pool to bring more motivation and attract international players. Anyone can sponsor GSC by donating resources to a [dedicated account](https://minesweeper.online/player/5619613). Any kind of resources are accepted while different resources apply different allocating rules. All resources fall into one of the following categories:
- Currency: coins and gems. The prices of gems are relatively stable so we can do conversions. Currently, 1 gem = 395 coins.
- Floating-value items: tickets and equips.

The allocation start from the top players (in terms of T.37). Every player can pick either currency or **one** floating-value item. The amount of currency the player can get is calculated as follows:

- The 1st can get the maximum between 200k or 5% of total currency pool. We calculate the ratio `p` by `p = (top prize)/pool`. For example, if the pool is 2M, then p=10%. If the pool is 5M, then the top prize is 250k and p=5%.
- The following players can get up to `p*(remaining pool)`, rounded up. For example, if the pool is 2M and the first player takes 200k, then the second player can take up to 1.8M\*10%=180k. If the first player takes an equipment instead, then the second player can take up to 200k. Taking less than what you can get or taking a floating-value item will affect everyone downstream.

### FAQ
#### How do I keep track of the prize pool? Who runs the prize pool?
The prize pool is updated [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uP6P3oERcd_POmXP8-vP2Yl0VrIyVny9mmegvZxx2-A/edit?usp=sharing). It's hosted by [Tian-yi Pu](https://minesweepergame.com/profile.php?pid=8747).

#### Will I get rewards automatically? What if I don't accept my rewards?
The GSC official account will contact you to discuss a solution when your rewards are ready. If you don't respond in 24 hours, you will be put in the next place in the queue until you respond. You can refuse to receive rewards or take less than what you can get.

#### What if there are remaining rewards?
If there are remaining items in the pool, they will be reserved for the next GSC.

#### Can I donate during GSC?
We don't accept donations during GSC and during the allocation process. But you can still issue an exchange. We will take them once our works are done.

#### Do I need WoM videos for WoM resources?
You still have to submit Arbiter videos to get WoM resources.
